## Welcome to Coastal Watters

This is a personal learning project using the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/nursethestrings/nursethestrings.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and content for my website in Markdown files.

Whenever I commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in my site, from the content in my Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/nursethestrings/nursethestrings.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
