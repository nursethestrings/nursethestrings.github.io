## Welcome to Coastal Watters

This is a personal learning project using the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/nursethestrings/coastalwatters/edit/master/README.md) to maintain content files.

Whenever I commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages from the content in my Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax  
for styling your writing. It includes conventions  
for setting text styles, headings, links, images,...
