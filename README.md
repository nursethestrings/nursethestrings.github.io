## Welcome to Coastal Watters

This is a personal learning project using the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/nursethestrings/nursethestrings.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and content for my website in Markdown files.

Whenever I commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in my site, from the content in my Markdown files.

### Markdown
